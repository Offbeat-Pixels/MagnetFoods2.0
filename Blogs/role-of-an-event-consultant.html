          Looking Forward to Hiring an Event Consultant? Here's What You Should
          Look for….
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">
          Are you excited about the upcoming wedding in your family? We can
          understand that apart from the joy of all the festivities, you are
          also worried about how you will be able to manage every responsibility
          that has come your way. Managing every aspect of the wedding is not a
          job for the faint hearted, after all, they are not called the big fat
          Indian wedding just like that. Every function from haldi to bhaat, to
          sangeet and cocktail, to the actual wedding and reception require lots
          of preparation. A sensible thing would be to let professionals assist
          you so that you can enjoy the festivities without any worries.
          Thankfully, we have event consultant and manager available to take
          care of every possible situation.

          What is the Role of an Event Consultant?
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">
          Planning an event, especially one at a large scale is not everyone’s
          cup of tea. There are several things which might go out of hand.
          However, instead of managing everything on your own, you can take the
          assistance of event consultants. If you know what you want but don’t
          know how to get it done, hiring an event consultant would make things
          easy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mb-2 sm:mb-4">
          What to look for before hiring an event consultant?
        </h2>
        <div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
          <img
            class="w-full max-w-xs sm:max-w-md h-auto"

          />
        </div>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg">
          Sometimes people hire event consultant to plan the event, while others
          have some ideas but need professionals to execute it. Whatever your
          requirement, ensure that you discuss it with prospective candidates
          before hiring one. If you have decided to trust the responsibilities
          of the event to an event consultant, here’s what you should keep in
          mind before hiring one:
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg sm:text-xl font-bold mb-2 sm:mb-4">
